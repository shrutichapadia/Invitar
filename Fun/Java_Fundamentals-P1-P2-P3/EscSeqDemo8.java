//Touch upon some literals concepts L, F, "x" vs 'x'
/* Q: Is a string consisting of a single character the same as a character literal? For
example, is "k" the same as 'k'?
A: No. You must not confuse strings with characters. A character literal represents a single
letter of type char. A string containing only one letter is still a string. Although strings
consist of characters, they are not the same type.
